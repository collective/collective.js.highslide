About Highslide
===============

Highslide JS is an image, media and gallery viewer written in JavaScript. These are some of its advantages:
Tip!
Use the visual Highslide Editor to set up your Highslide installation without writing code.

* Quick and elegant looking.
* No plugins like Flash or Java required.
* Popup blockers are no problem. The content opens within the active browser window.
* Single click. After opening the image or HTML popup, the user can scroll further down or leave the page without closing it.
* Lots of configuration options and scalability without compromizing on simplicity. A component system lets you strip away unused features down to a filesize of 10kB.
* Outstanding, unconditional and free user support for both commercial and non-commercial users.
* Compatibility and safe degrading. If the user has disabled JavaScript or is using an old browser, the browser redirects directly to the image itself or to a given HTML page.
* Source code included.
